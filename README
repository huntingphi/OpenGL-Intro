# OpenGL Intro Prac

Compile with make, run with make run

The following settings were used:
    Projection matrix : 45Â° Field of View, 4:3 ratio, display range : 0.1 unit <-> 100 units
    Camera is at (0,0,3), in World Space (On the Z-Axis)

Controls:
    The assignment spec indicates that keys should be used to switch to different transformations but the transformations themselves should be mouse driven.
    The following controls were therefore implemented.
    The model will load in view mode by default where no transformations may be applied.
    Scaling mode can be entered with the S key. The object will scale based on the movement of the mouse.
    Rotating mode can be entered with the R key. Repeatedly hitting R will toggle between rotation on the X and on the Y axis. The object will rotate based on the movement of the mouse.
    Translating mode can be entered with the T key. The object will move based on the movement of the mouse.

    Extra: The modes can also be controlled with the arrow keys where up and right correspond to positive and left and down to negative, in the context of an imaginary cartesian plane centered at the center of the window.

Color changes at random with any transformation (when driven by the mouse) but can also be changed to a random color by hitting c.


Final notes:
    Although a working implementation wasn't completed for two images, two models were loaded in the buffer. (See OpenGLInit2() method).
